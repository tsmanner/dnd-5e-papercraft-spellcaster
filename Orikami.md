---

**Hit Points**
**Hit Dice**: 1d8 per orimagi level
**Hit Points at 1st Level**: 8 + your Constitution modifier
**Hit Points at Higher Levels**: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per orimagi level after 1st

### Additional Proficiencies

**Saving Throws:** Wisdom

### Divine Magic

Magical power derived from the spirit of the land allows you to fold divine magic into your origami, and allows you to store up to two times your Orimagi levels in spell slots worth of origami at once.

### Improved Familiar

When you cast Find Familiar, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.

Additionally, your familiar can either take the Attack action to make a single attack, or cast a spell on it's turn, but not both.  It can cast any cantrips that you know, and you can give it a number of folded spells, which can have a combined level that is equal to or less than the number shown in the Familiar Spells column of the Orikami Table.  These spells expend your spell slots when cast, but do not count toward your Origami Cap.  If a spell cast by your familiar requires concentration, you must maintain concentration on that spell.

### Cantrips

You know a number of cantrips equal to your Wisdom modifier, minimum 1.  You are so familiar with the folds necessary to cast these spells, that you can create the effect at will, by miming the process.

### Spell List

The Spells Known column of the Orikami Table shows when you learn more druid spells of 1st level or higher.

#### Orikami Spells

You gain access to the spells at the orimagi levels listed in the Orikami Spells table.
