# Orimagi (name is WIP)

Proposal for a homebrew D&amp;D 5e spellcasting class that casts spells by binding arcane, divine, or spiritual energy to sheets of paper through an elaborate series of folds.
Intended to be a DEX spellcaster.  May be a full or half caster, we haven't decided yet.  The inspiration for this class is magical origami, so the archetype names all begin with "ori," the Japanese word meaning "fold."

## Basic Mechanics

### Cantrips
You know 1 + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier cantrips, minimum 1.  You are so familiar with the folds necessary to cast these spells, that you can create the effect at will, by miming the process

### Preparing and Casting Spells
All spells are cast as rituals, stored in pre-folded origami pieces which lose their magic at the end of a long rest.  Any origami that remains at the end of the day can be easily unfolded and returned to your binder. The caster can maintain up to their Orimagi levels in spell slots worth of magic origami at once.
Higher level spells require more intricate folding, and therefore take longer to prepare.  Spells take `10 - DEX` minutes to prepare, per spell level.  Upcasting spells requires that they be prepared already upcast.
The magic in a prepared spell dissipates if it leaves the possession of the Orimagi that folded it.

Casting the prepared spell requires releasing the energy contained therein, requiring the normal verbal, somatic, and/or material components the spell would otherwise require.
For example, the [Revivify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/revivify) spell is 3rd level, takes 1 Action to cast, and requires verbal, somatic, and material components (300gp of diamonds, which are consumed).  An Orimagi would take `30 - (3 x DEX)` (`15-30`) minutes to prepare this spell at some point during the day, then could cast it once as an action.  At the time of the casting, the material components must be present <sup>Should this apply also at the time of storing the spell?</sup>.  Casting a spell in this way consumes the origami figure.  You must use the origami as a spellcasting focus for your orimagi spells.

### Spellcasting Ability
**Spell save D** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

## Archetypes

## Divine Full Caster

Name Ideas
  - Orikami (god/diety/divinity/spirit)

### Divine Magic
Magical power derived from a patron diety allows you to fold divine magic into your origami, and allows you to store up to two times your Orimagi levels in spell slots worth of origami at once.  Your spellcasting ability is Wisdom.

## Arcane Full Caster
  - Orimah≈ç (magic/sorcery)
  - Oribodai (knowledge)

### Arcane Magic
You derive your power from studying/tinkering/fidgeting with arcane magic, allowing you to fold this arcane power into your origami, and allows you to store up to two times your Orimagi levels in spell slots worth of origami at once.  Your spellcasting ability is Intelligence.

## Martial Half Caster
  - Oriken (blade/sabre/bayonet/sting/clock hand) or (health/strength)
  - Oribuyoku (force/military strength/armed might)

### Ki Magic (or something similar)
You are able to draw on your own powers of focus, and your body's spiritual essence to animate your origami.  It allows you to augment your own physical abilities with origami creations and spells.
