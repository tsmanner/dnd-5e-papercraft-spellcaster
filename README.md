# Orimagi (name is WIP)

Proposal for a homebrew D&amp;D 5e spellcasting class that casts spells by binding arcane, divine, or spiritual energy to sheets of paper through an elaborate series of folds.
Intended to be a DEX spellcaster.  May be a full or half caster, we haven't decided yet.  The inspiration for this class is magical origami, so the archetype names all begin with "ori," the Japanese word meaning "fold."

## Basic Mechanics

### Proficiencies
**Saving Throws:** Dexterity

### Cantrips
Cantrips known are determined by your Archetype.

### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Orimagi archetype table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your orimagi spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Orimagi must fold figurines which hold their spells for the day.  The Orimagi archetype table shows the number of spells you can maintain at any one time.  Once a spell is cast, you are able to prepare additional spells up to your spell limit, as long as you are able to fold an origimai figurine.  Preparing a spell in this way takes `10 - your Dexterity modifier` minutes per level of the spell slot for each spell you fold.  In order to cast spells at a higher level, they must be prepared at that level.  The magic in a prepared spell dissipates if it leaves the possession of the Orimagi that folded it.

Prepared spells can be reclaimed without expending any spell slots by unfolding them as an action.

Casting the prepared spell requires releasing the energy contained therein by using the normal verbal, somatic, and/or material components of the spell.
For example, the [Revivify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/revivify) spell is 3rd level, takes 1 Action to cast, and requires verbal, somatic, and material components (300gp of diamonds, which are consumed).  An Orimagi would take `30 - (3 x DEX)` (`15-30`) minutes to prepare this spell at some point during the day, then could cast it once as an action.  At the time of the casting, the material components must be present.  Casting a spell in this way consumes the origami figure.  You must use the origami as a spellcasting focus for your orimagi spells.

**Spellcasting Focus**

Your origami counts as a spellcasting focus for your Orimagi spells.

### Spellcasting Ability
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

### Papercraft Familiar
You learn the [Find Familiar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/find-familiar) spell and can cast it as a ritual.  The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.  The familiar you create is an animated origami version of the creature you choose.

### Additional Proficiencies

**Saving Throws:** Wisdom

### Divine Magic

Magical power derived from the spirit of the land allows you to fold divine magic into your origami, and allows you to store up to two times your Orimagi levels in spell slots worth of origami at once.

### Improved Familiar

When you cast Find Familiar, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.

Additionally, your familiar can either take the Attack action to make a single attack, or cast a spell on it's turn, but not both.  It can cast any cantrips that you know, and you can give it a number of folded spells, which can have a combined level that is equal to or less than the number shown in the Familiar Spells column of the Orikami Table.  These spells expend your spell slots when cast, but do not count toward your Origami Cap.  If a spell cast by your familiar requires concentration, you must maintain concentration on that spell.

### Cantrips

You know a number of cantrips equal to your Wisdom modifier, minimum 1.  You are so familiar with the folds necessary to cast these spells, that you can create the effect at will, by miming the process.

### Spell List

The Spells Known column of the Orikami Table shows when you learn more druid spells of 1st level or higher.

#### Orikami Spells

You gain access to the spells at the orimagi levels listed in the Orikami Spells table.

| Orimagi Level |                               Spells |

### Additional Proficiencies
**Saving Throws:** Intelligence

### Spell List
Wizard? Sorcerer? Some Druid?

### Cantrips
You a number of cantrips equal to know your Intelligence cantrips, minimum 1.  You are so familiar with the folds necessary to cast these spells, that you can create the effect at will, by miming the process.

### Arcane Magic
You derive your power from studying/tinkering/fidgeting with arcane magic, allowing you to fold this arcane power into your origami, and allows you to store up to two times your Orimagi levels in spell slots worth of origami at once.

### Folding Patterns
You are able to find patterns in the way the folds of your origami affect the spells they represent.  You are able to fold your origami so that small modifications to it can change the spell contained within.  As a bonus action you can change the spell slot by 1 level, or change the spell to another spell of the same school, that can be cast at the same level.  To cast the modified spell, you still follow the normal rules for casting a spell.  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Additional Proficiencies
- **Saving Throws:** Constitution
- Heavy Armor
- Martial Weapons

### Paper Cut
When you hit with a melee attack, as Part of the Attack, you animate a piece of paper to slice alongside your weapon.  You can add you Paper Cut dice to the damage of your attack, inflicting bonus slashing damage to the target.  The sting of the attack imposes disadvantage on the first attack roll or saving throw made by the creature before the end of your next turn.  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short rest.

### Spell List
You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and transmutation spells on the wizard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Oriken/Oribuyoku Table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.
