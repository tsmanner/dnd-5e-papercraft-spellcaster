### Spellcasting

You channel magical energy by folding paper in particular patterns.  Orimagi are capable of drawing on magic from all sources.  See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the {spell-list} spell list.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know cantrips of your choice from {spell-list}.  You learn additional {spell-list} cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the {Class} table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The {class} table shows how many spells slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher.  To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.  You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare spells by folding paper figurines, which hold the magical energy needed for the spell they represent.  Instead of a spellbook, orimagi have a magical portfolio, which can maintain a number of spell levels equal to {1,2} times your orimagi level.  When you prepare spells, the folded paper can be kept in your portfolio until the spell is cast.  The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  You may fold more spells of a level than you have spell slots of that level, but you may not cast all of them.

For example, if you have two 2nd-level spell slots and fold one of each *barkskin*, *flaming sphere*, and *healing spirit*, and you cast *barkskin* and *flaming sphere*, you may not cast *healing spirit* today.  The energy of the folded *healing spirit* spell remains in the portfolio, however, and you would not need to fold it the next day if you wanted to have access to a casting of it.

You can change your set of prepared spells at any time by unfolding a spell as an Action, and folding new spells.  Folding a spell takes 10 - your Dexterity modifier minutes.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Dexterity is your spellcasting ability for your orimagi spells, since your magic relies on executing the folds with precision.  You use your Dexterity whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.  In addition, you use your Dexterity modifer when setting the saving throw DC for an orimagi spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a {spell-list} spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.  You do not need to have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus

Your origami figurings are the spellcasting focus for the spell.  Your cantrips do not require a spellcasting focus.
