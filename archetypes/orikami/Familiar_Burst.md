### Familiar Burst

On your turn, you may choose to use your action to cast any spell you know without expending a spell slot or consuming an origami figurine.  The spell you cast may be up to the level of spell energy your familiar can hold at once.  Casting a spell in this way consumes your familiar.<sup>This may need to be level gated, maybe when the familiar gains level 2 spells?</sup>
