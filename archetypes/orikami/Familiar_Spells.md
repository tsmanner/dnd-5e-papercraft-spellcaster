### Familiar Spells

Beginning at 4th level, your familiar can hold, and cast, your prepared spells.  When you prepare a spell, you can choose to store that spell with your familiar instead of in your portfolio.  If you do so, you can use a Bonus Action on your turn to command your familiar to cast the spell.  Casting a spell in this way consumes the prepared spell, and expends a spell slot as if you had cast the spell.

Spells prepared in this way do not count toward your Origami Cap.  Your familiar can hold a number of levels of spell energy as shown in the Familiar Spells column of the {Class} Table.  If a spell cast by your familiar requires concentration, you must maintain concentration on that spell.
