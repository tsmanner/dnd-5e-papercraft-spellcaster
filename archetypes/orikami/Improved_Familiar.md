### Improved Familiar

When you cast Find Familiar, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.

Additionally, your familiar can learn and cast a number of your known cantrips from the {spell_list} as shown in the Familiar Cantrips column of the Orikami Table.  Your familiar casts cantrips as if it were half of your orikami level.  You can use a Bonus Action on your turn to command your familiar to cast one of these cantrips.
