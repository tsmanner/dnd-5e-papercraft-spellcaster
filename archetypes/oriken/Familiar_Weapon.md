### Familiar Weapon

You are able to incorporate your familiar into your martial techniques.  As a Bonus Action, you can command your familiar to merge with your weapon for up to 1 minute.  You must use your Bonus Action on your turn to maintain this effect.  While your familiar is merged with your weapon, your attacks may have an additional effect.  You may only apply one additional effect to an attack.  If you are able to make multiple attacks in one turn, such as with the Extra Attack feature, you may choose different effects for each attack.

You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Modifier.  You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
