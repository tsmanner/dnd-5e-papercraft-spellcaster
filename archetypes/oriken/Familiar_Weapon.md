### Familiar Weapon

You are able to incorporate your familiar into your martial techniques.  As a Bonus Action, you can command your familiar to merge or unmerge with your weapon.  While your familiar is merged with your weapon, when you hit with a weapon attack, you can use a Bonus Action to deal an additional 1d4 slashing damage to the target.
